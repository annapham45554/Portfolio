    <a href="https://www.artstation.com/wlop" target="_blank"><h3>WLOP</h3></a>
   <p>WLOP is the nickname of Wang Ling, a Hong Kong-based Chinese digital artist and software
      engineer. He is famous for his luminous fantasy theme art style with digital painting, which
      attracts hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide. His style has a mix of 2D and 3D, along
      with the use of general cool tone colors. His art inspired me to create something unique for
      myself, to have my own style instead of following the trend.</p>

   <p>Craig Elliot is an illustrator, visual layout, visual development artist, production designer, and art
      director who works in the animation industry, notably Disney, DreamWorks, Sony, and Warner
      Bros. I mostly pay attention to Elliotâ€™s Disney concept art because of the way he uses bright,
      colorful color scheme in his works. He inspired me to draw animation and characters.</p>
